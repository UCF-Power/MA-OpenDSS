# MA-OpenDSS
Multi-Agent OpenDSS (MA-OpenDSS) Platform is built upon OpenDSS. The MA-OpenDSS incorporates an asynchronous, local, possibly varying communication architecture, enables a set of virtual nodes (called virtual leaders) to coordinate local data sharing and actions, includes programmable dynamic blocks for behaviors of distributed energy resources, and implements a host of distributed and cooperative algorithms of estimation, optimization and control. It is specifically developed to simulate and investigate self-organizing microgrids and large-scale electricity distribution networks with extremely high renewable penetrations.
